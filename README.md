## üé® Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I am inspired by the bold, gestural abstraction in *Untitled Bull* by **Elaine de Kooning**, combined with the flat color blocking and line work typical of **pop art** (e.g. Andy Warhol‚Äôs *Do It Yourself (Violin)*). I aim to reinterpret the bull using abstract shapes, expressive brush-like movement, and bold contouring. These aesthetics help me explore dynamic identity and bodily fragmentation through form.

## üß† Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To bring the abstraction to life, I will use **poseNet body-tracking in p5.js** to allow user motion to deform and recompose the abstract bull form. This interactive approach brings energy and participation, echoing the playfulness of pop art. I'm also inspired by **scanner-style wave distortion** and **ASCII symbol rendering**, which offer alternative ways to abstract visual forms.
